            <h2>The Evolution: ThreadWeaver to Parinama</h2>
            <p class="lead">Every great innovation builds on what came before. ADPD³'s story begins with ThreadWeaver and ODPD.</p>

                    <h3>ThreadWeaver: The Foundation</h3>
                    <p>ThreadWeaver introduced ODPD (Outcome-Driven Product Development), a systematic approach to building products that deliver measurable outcomes. It laid the groundwork for thinking about products as interconnected threads of value, not isolated features.</p>
                    <p>But as powerful as ThreadWeaver was, we noticed a pattern: even products with clear outcomes were failing at adoption. The gap between "built" and "used" remained wide.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>The Adoption Revelation</h3>
                    <p>We realized that focusing on outcomes wasn't enough. A product could deliver incredible outcomes, but if users couldn't find it, understand it, or use it easily, those outcomes would never be realized.</p>
                    <p>This led to ADPD³—Adoption-Driven Product Design, Development & Delivery. Instead of starting with outcomes, we start with adoption. Every decision is filtered through the FUSE framework: Findability, Understandability, Shippability, and Ease of Use.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto;">
                <h3>From Designer to Creator</h3>
                <p>I am a product manager by trade and a lifelong learner with over 30 years of expertise in computer hardware and enterprise software across financial services and manufacturing. When the GenAI revolution arrived, I didn't just adapt—I transformed. I upskilled myself to leverage AI capabilities, morphing from a designer of software to a creator.</p>
                
                <p>I've developed powerful solutions in RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), fine-tuning models, and standalone applications for product management, skills matching, recommendation engines, and marketing automation. But more importantly, I discovered how to use AI to go beyond productivity—to explore possibilities that were previously impossible for me to achieve alone.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto;">
                <h3>Teaching and Building Teams</h3>
                <p>Throughout my career, I've taught the craft of product management to over 500 analysts and coached/mentored over 50 product managers. I specialize in building high-functioning, self-governing teams that can tackle extreme complexity, stress, and uncertainty to deliver planet-scale solutions.</p>
                
                <p>My approach has always been simple but powerful: help teams focus on meaningful problems AND ensure their solutions are adopted by customers. This philosophy led to the development of ADPD³—a methodology that leverages AI as a force multiplier, drastically reducing development time while simultaneously reducing risk.</p>

                "I provided the vision and detailed requirements. AI—primarily Claude and GPT—wrote every line of code.

                EMPOWER ANYONE with an IDEA that SOLVES a meaningful PROBLEM TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, and DELIVER their SOLUTION AND ENSURE their CUSTOMERS are DELIGHTED!

            <h3>Built by Us, Powered by YOU</h3>
            <p>This philosophy drives everything we do. We believe that the best ideas often come from those closest to the problems—not necessarily those who can code. By democratizing software development through ADPD³ methodology and AI collaboration, we're unlocking human potential at an unprecedented scale.</p>
            
            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>In a world where software is eating everything, the ability to build software shouldn't be limited to programmers. Domain experts, business leaders, innovators—anyone with a vision for solving real problems should be able to bring their ideas to life.</p>
            
            <p>ADPD³ provides the methodology. AI provides the implementation. You provide the vision.</p>
            
            <p>Together, we're not just building software. We're building a future where great ideas don't die because of technical barriers.</p>
