            <h2>The Evolution: ThreadWeaver to Parinama</h2>
            <p class="lead">Every great innovation builds on what came before. ADPD's story begins with ThreadWeaver and ODPD.</p>

                    <h3>ThreadWeaver: The Foundation</h3>
                    <p>ThreadWeaver introduced ODPD (Outcome-Driven Product Development), a systematic approach to building products that deliver measurable outcomes. It laid the groundwork for thinking about products as interconnected threads of value, not isolated features.</p>
                    <p>But as powerful as ThreadWeaver was, we noticed a pattern: even products with clear outcomes were failing at adoption. The gap between "built" and "used" remained wide.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>The Adoption Revelation</h3>
                    <p>We realized that focusing on outcomes wasn't enough. A product could deliver incredible outcomes, but if users couldn't find it, understand it, or use it easily, those outcomes would never be realized.</p>
                    <p>This led to ADPDâ€”Adoption-Driven Product Design, Development & Delivery. Instead of starting with outcomes, we start with adoption. Every decision is filtered through the FUSE framework: Findability, Understandability, Shippability, and Ease of Use.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto;">
                <h3>From Designer to Creator</h3>
                <p>I am a product manager by trade and a lifelong learner with over 30 years of expertise in computer hardware and enterprise software across financial services and manufacturing. When the GenAI revolution arrived, I didn't just adaptâ€”I transformed. I upskilled myself to leverage AI capabilities, morphing from a designer of software to a creator.</p>
                
                <p>I've developed powerful solutions in RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), fine-tuning models, and standalone applications for product management, skills matching, recommendation engines, and marketing automation. But more importantly, I discovered how to use AI to go beyond productivityâ€”to explore possibilities that were previously impossible for me to achieve alone.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto;">
                <h3>Teaching and Building Teams</h3>
                <p>Throughout my career, I've taught the craft of product management to over 500 analysts and coached/mentored over 50 product managers. I specialize in building high-functioning, self-governing teams that can tackle extreme complexity, stress, and uncertainty to deliver planet-scale solutions.</p>
                
                <p>My approach has always been simple but powerful: help teams focus on meaningful problems AND ensure their solutions are adopted by customers. This philosophy led to the development of ADPDâ€”a methodology that leverages AI as a force multiplier, drastically reducing development time while simultaneously reducing risk.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                "I provided the vision and detailed requirements. AIâ€”primarily Claude and GPTâ€”wrote every line of code. Together, we built enterprise-grade software that rivals products created by large development teams. It's not about doing the same work fasterâ€”it's about doing work that was not possible before."

                EMPOWER ANYONE with an IDEA that SOLVES a meaningful PROBLEM TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, and DELIVER their SOLUTION AND ENSURE their CUSTOMERS are DELIGHTED!
            </p>
            
            <h3>Built by Us, Powered by YOU</h3>
            <p>This philosophy drives everything we do. We believe that the best ideas often come from those closest to the problemsâ€”not necessarily those who can code. By democratizing software development through ADPD methodology and AI collaboration, we're unlocking human potential at an unprecedented scale.</p>
            
            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>In a world where software is eating everything, the ability to build software shouldn't be limited to programmers. Domain experts, business leaders, innovatorsâ€”anyone with a vision for solving real problems should be able to bring their ideas to life.</p>
            
            <p>ADPD provides the methodology. AI provides the implementation. You provide the vision.</p>
            
            <p>Together, we're not just building software. We're building a future where great ideas don't die because of technical barriers.</p>
