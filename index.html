            <h2>The Adoption Problem</h2>
            <p class="lead">90% of products fail not because they lack features, but because they fail at adoption. Amazing capabilities go unused. Powerful solutions get abandoned. The gap between what we build and what users actually adopt has never been wider.</p>
            
            <p>Traditional product development treats adoption as an afterthought—something to worry about after launch. ADPD flips this model entirely. We design for adoption from day one, thinking about real-world usage before writing a single line of code.</p>

            <h2>Introducing ADPD</h2>
            <p><strong>Adoption-Driven Product Design, Development & Delivery</strong> is a revolutionary methodology that ensures every product decision is filtered through the lens of user adoption. It works across any industry and transforms how we think about building software.</p>

            <h2>The Future is AI-Human Collaboration</h2>
            <p class="lead">Parinama wasn't built by a team of developers. It was built through a revolutionary collaboration between human vision and AI implementation.</p>
            
            <p>This isn't "no-code" or "low-code"—it's something entirely new. By providing clear requirements and leveraging AI as an implementation partner, we've created enterprise-grade software that rivals products built by large development teams.</p>
            
            <p>The best part? Anyone can do this. ADPD provides the methodology. AI provides the implementation. You provide the vision.</p>
